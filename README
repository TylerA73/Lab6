Lab Assignment 6

Information: This program utilizes the abstract class defined in list.h by using the Stack and Queue classes created and derived from it. They act as containers for integer values, and will store them with the same behaviour as a Stack and Queue would. The Main.cpp will test these classes out extensively.

Files Included: makefile, README, list.h, stack.h, queue.h, stack.cpp, queue.cpp, main.cpp

Step 1: Change the directory in terminal to "Lab6"
Step 2: In Terminal, type make to compile the program.
Step 3: In Terminal, type "./prog" to run the program.
